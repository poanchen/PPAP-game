# try-to-avoid-PPAP-game v1.0.11
Initially, four enemies (PPAP's face) will start at the corner. In the start of the game, each enemy will go with different direction and bounce back if they hit the wall. You may win the game by directing the PEN with your mouse cursor to go through the APPLE and PINEAPPLE, and then back to the base (Wooden board) in under 30 seconds. You may lost by being too close to the enemies or took more than 30 seconds to complete. In case you do not know what PPAP is, please go ahead and watch this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFlgNoUsr4k).
